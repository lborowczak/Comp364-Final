Memory leaks can cause severe performance problems
-C++ has no garbage collector
-Fixing them can make the program much faster even if you think you are doing more memory operations


Small changes that you think are better can decrease performance (Eliminated an else and replaced a check with a boolean, but still had worse performance, compiler?)

Java to C++ is not hard
